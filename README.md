# Supply Chain Database & Dashboard

This project implements a relational database system using **MySQL** and enhances insights through **Power BI dashboards** to support data-driven decision-making for a distribution company, *Richardâ€™s Supply*. The system manages and analyzes critical components of the supply chain, including customers, suppliers, orders, and products.

## Business Problem

Richardâ€™s Supply partners with a network of suppliers to distribute a wide range of products across multiple countries. Despite accumulating operational data over two years, the company struggles to:

- Identify top suppliers and high-demand products  
- Understand inactive or under-engaged customers  
- Measure the financial impact of discounts  
- Assist new suppliers with actionable insights  

The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful, strategic business intelligence that supports operational efficiency, supplier engagement, and customer satisfaction.
